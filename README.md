# Python API Challenge

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Then, I used jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to map my findings.
